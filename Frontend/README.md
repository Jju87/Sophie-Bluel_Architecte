# Second OpenClassRooms project "SOPHIE BLUEL"

# Architect's Portfolio Website

This project is a dynamic architect's portfolio website built with JavaScript. 
It showcases the ability to interact with an API to generate and manage projects.

## Features

- Dynamic Project Generation: The website fetches project data from an API and dynamically generates a list of projects. Each project includes a picture and a title.

- Category Filtering: Projects can be filtered by category. The categories are also fetched from the API.

- User Authentication: Users can log in to the website. The login functionality interacts with the API to authenticate users.

- Project Management: Logged in users can add new projects or delete existing ones. These changes are made to the API and are reflected on the website without having to reload the page.

### Usage

To see the functionality of the website: 
- clone the repo of the "julien-front" branch
- On a terminal, move to the Backend section of the repo, and type in npm install, and then npm start (you'll need node.js installed)
- You can then run the website on a local server.

Use the following credentials to log in:

- Email: sophie.bluel@test.tld
- Password: S0phie
Once logged in, you can add new projects or delete existing ones by clicking on "modifier".

## Goals
The main goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript and interacting with APIs. It shows the ability to fetch data from an API, dynamically generate HTML based on this data, and make changes to the API through POST and DELETE requests.

## Future Improvements
While the current version of the website is fully functional, there are several potential improvements that could be made in the future:

- Implement a more secure authentication system.
- Add the ability to edit existing projects.
- Improve the UI/UX of the website.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical demonstration of using JavaScript to interact with APIs. It showcases the ability to create a dynamic, interactive website that can fetch data from an API, update the API, and reflect these changes on the website without having to reload the page.
