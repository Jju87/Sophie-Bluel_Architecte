## Features

- **User Authentication**: Once logged in, the architect Sophie Bluel will be able to upload or delete media on her portfolio website.
- **API Communication**: Communicating with an API (tests were made using Swagger/Postman).
- **DOM Manipulation**: Manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript.
- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Dynamically updating data to avoid page reloads for the user.

## Back-End Development

I completely rebuilt the back-end of this project to allow online deployment. I used Express and MongoDB, following the front-end logic.

- **CDN Hosting**: Images, previously stored locally, are now hosted on a CDN.
- **Image Moderation**: Added a middleware to moderate posted images.
